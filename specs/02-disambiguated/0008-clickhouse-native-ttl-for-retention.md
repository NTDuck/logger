# 0008. ClickHouse Native TTL for Log Retention

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The system requires an automatic log cleanup feature (a Log Retention Policy) to compress or delete INFO-level logs older than 7 days to manage disk space. 
Initially, the proposed solution was to implement a custom background cron job running in the application layer that would periodically execute `DELETE` queries against the database. 
However, ClickHouse is an OLAP database designed around immutable data parts and optimized for extreme write throughput. Executing standard `DELETE` or `ALTER TABLE ... DELETE` queries forces massive, heavy, asynchronous rewrites of those data parts on disk. Implementing this via application-level cron jobs introduces runtime risk, severe I/O spikes, and database fragmentation.
Additionally, allowing a System Admin to configure the retention threshold dynamically via a runtime Viewer dashboard would require executing `ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY TTL` (a Data Definition Language mutation) on an active cluster. This introduces distributed deadlocks, write stalls, ZooKeeper timeouts, and configuration drift between the live DB and the infrastructure codebase.

## Decision
We will manage DB Retention strictly via ClickHouse native TTL (Time-To-Live) configurations (e.g., `TTL timestamp + INTERVAL 7 DAY DELETE WHERE level = 'INFO'`) defined in Infrastructure-as-Code.
- The retention policy will be configured via an environment variable (e.g., `LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=7`).
- A database initialization script will read this variable and apply the `CREATE TABLE ... TTL` statement.
- We explicitly reject allowing the Viewer or any runtime services to execute DDL mutations for log cleanup. If the TTL must change, it must be updated via infrastructure deployment. The Admin Dashboard can display the current TTL (by querying the `system.tables` dictionary in ClickHouse), but it should never be granted the database privileges required to execute `ALTER TABLE`.

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Data eviction is managed predictably and optimally by the ClickHouse background merge processes without manual application-layer intervention.
- **Positive**: Eliminates custom background jobs and avoids the severe I/O spikes associated with manual `DELETE` statements in ClickHouse.
- **Positive**: Eliminates configuration drift and locking issues by treating the database schema as immutable infrastructure.
- **Negative**: Retention policies are less dynamic and require formal infrastructure deployments to modify.
