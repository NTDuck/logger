# 0015. Delta Updates on Log Status Topic

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our log processing pipeline involves multiple stages: a single log progresses from `Raw` to `Processed`, then to `Stored`, and potentially `Categorized` by the AI system. The Viewer subsystem needs to display these lifecycle transitions in real-time. The architectural plan relies on an event-driven status pipeline where services publish status updates to a dedicated `log-status` compacted topic in Redpanda.

The fundamental challenge arises in how we communicate these state changes. The logs can be quite large (e.g., massive structured JSON payloads, exception blobs up to 64KB).

## Alternatives Considered & The Debate
During the architecture grilling session, two main options were debated:

1. **Full Payload Broadcasting (Rejected)**
   The naive approach allows internal services (like the Normalization Worker or the DB Writer) to blindly copy-paste the entire massive log payload into every single status transition event published to the `log-status` topic.
   *Why it was rejected:* A single log transitions states at least 3-4 times. If an average log's payload (Attributes, Message, Trace ID) is 2KB, and your system handles 1,000 logs per second, duplicating the entire 2KB JSON blob for every lifecycle stage artificially quadruples Kafka network traffic and disk I/O from 2MB/sec to 8MB/sec purely to update a status string. This network amplification would saturate bandwidth and choke the broker, causing the system to collapse under its own weight in a high-throughput production environment.

2. **Delta Updates / Partial Payloads (Accepted)**
   Enforce strict Delta Updates on the `log-status` topic.
   - **The Initial Event:** When the Receiver gets the log, it publishes the full payload: `{"status": "raw", "payload": { ...the full 2KB log... }}`.
   - **The Delta Events:** When the Worker or AI Consumer finishes their jobs, they *do not* attach the full payload. They only send the diff: `{"status": "stored", "Log_ID": "123"}` or `{"status": "categorized", "Log_ID": "123", "ai_tags": ["anomaly"]}`.

## Decision
We will strictly implement **Delta Updates (Partial Payloads)** on the `log-status` topic. Services publishing to this state machine topic must use Delta Updates for all transitions after the initial "Raw" event.

To make this work for the end user, the Viewer's WebSocket server will act as an in-memory reducer. It will maintain an in-memory map of `Log_ID -> State`, receive these lightweight `PATCH` events from the tail of the topic, merge the new status/tags into the existing full payload in RAM, and then push only the lightweight WebSocket PATCH down to the engineer's browser.

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Drastically minimizes network bandwidth consumption and disk I/O on the Redpanda cluster (slashing it by up to 75% for state tracking) without sacrificing a single byte of context for the end user.
- **Positive**: Enables smooth UI transitions for engineers without requiring full row re-renders or transferring massive JSON blobs repeatedly over WebSockets.
- **Negative**: Adds state-management complexity to the Viewer's WebSocket server, which must intelligently handle state merging and potential out-of-order updates (e.g., if a "stored" event arrives slightly before a "processed" event due to network jitter).
