## Execution Wave DAG

- **Wave 1:** `T001` (Setup)
- **Wave 2:** `T002`, `T004`, `T006`, `T008`, `T010`, `T012`, `T014`, `T016` (All Phase A TDD scaffolds can be run in parallel by the coding agent across different terminals)
- **Wave 3:** `T003`, `T005`, `T007`, `T009`, `T011`, `T013`, `T015`, `T017` (Implementations, each dependent on their respective Phase A)

## Implementation Strategy

### The "TDD Gatekeeper" Strategy
Do not let the coding agent claim it successfully wrote the logic. Force it to run `cargo nextest run`, and rely strictly on the compiler and the BDD test output to verify if the LLM actually followed the dense architectural notes embedded in the `v3` files.
